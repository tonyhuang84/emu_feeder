### Dependence

This emulator shall operate on the node.js. It depends on several node modules.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v10 or higher
* [express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws)

### OS update

Environment setting procedure is explained, having [Raspbian] on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) as an example. As stated below, update the Raspbian package beforehand.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y
$ sudo reboot
```

### Installing Node.js body

```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get -y install nodejs
```

This completes the installation of the node main body. Execute the following commands and check if the version is displayed.

```
$ node -v
v10.0.0
```

### Installing Node module

Install the node module that the emulator depends on.

```
$ cd ~
$ npm install express
$ npm install ws
```

This completes the environment configuration to activate this emulator.

### Installing the emulator

Copy the entire directory `elemu` from  this emulator to the home directory. You can copy it to anywhere.

This completes installation of this emulator.

---------------------------------------
## <a id="startup-emulator">starting EL emulator</a>

Directory `elemu` of the EL emulator body shall be installed immediately below the `/home/pi`. The EL emulator shall be started as follows with `pi` user privileges: Any user can actually start the EL emulator; however, due to the writing process required for the files within `elemu`, only users who have copied the emulator directory `elemu`  may start the EL emulator.

```
$ cd ~/elemu
$ node index.js
```

After completion of startup, the following message will appear on the shell:

![Start screen](imgs/console_start_1.png)

If you want to output the ECHONET Lite packet transmission status, startup can be done with a command switch option (see below).

```
$ node index.js --enable-console-packet
```

After completion of startup, the following message should be output on the console when this emulator transmits an ECHONET Lite packet.

---------------------------------------
## <a id="access-dashboard">dashboard</a>

Dashboard is provided as a Web app to operate on the Web browser. Accessing a host computer running the EL emulator using Web browser via port 8880 displays the dashboard. Access the following URL if accessing the dashboard from the browser opened on the computer that started this emulator.

```
http://localhost:8880
```

If the computer that started this emulator and the computer that displays the dashboard are different, the one that runs the emulator is Raspberry Pi and only one Raspberry Pi exists on the local network, and if the one displayed the dashboard supports Bonjour (mDNS/DNS-SD), then accessing through the URL is possible.

```
http://raspberrypi.local:8880
```

If access to the dashboard fails through the URL above, directly designate the IP address of the computer that runs the emulator.

```
http://192.168.11.3:8880
```

If access to the dashboard is successful, then the screen shown below will appear on the browser.

## <a id="header-icons">header icon</a>

The header of the dashboard has several icons. The meanings of the icons are as follows:

![Header icon](imgs/header_icons.png)

### Setting language

This dashboard supports Japanese and English. Selecting a language using the pull-down menu will automatically change the display to the selected language.

![Change Language](imgs/lang_english.png)


### WebSocket link icon

![WebSocket Link icon](imgs/ws_link_icon.png)

This icon shall indicate the WebSocket connection status between the dashboard and emulator. The icon is green if connected properly, and turns gray when disconnected. When the icon is gray, check if the emulator has started properly.

### Power button icon

![Power button icon](imgs/power_icon.png)

The icon is green if the emulator has started. Clicking this icon can temporarily suspend the emulator. The icon is gray when suspended. Clicking the icon once again will start up the emulator, turning the icon green. 

Pressing this button can change the emulator status. However, this does not mean that the emulator process is shut down. Changing the emulator status simply means that emulator operation is suspended. Even if the emulator is turned off, its process is still ongoing. This means that the dashboard is still in use.

### Setting button

![Setting button](imgs/conf_icon.png)

Pressing the button opens the setting screen of the emulator. For more details, see “[System configuration](#sys-conf)”.

### Home　button

![Home　button](imgs/home_icon.png)

Pressing the button when screens other than the Home screen are opened returns to the Home screen.

---------------------------------------
## <a id="sys-conf">System configuration</a>

In this screen, parameters to determine the operation of the emulator can be set. Although this screen does not normally require any change in a normal state, the settings should be changed if necessary.

![System Configurations screen](imgs/sys_conf.png)

There is Reset the System button at the bottom of the screen. Pressing the button resets the emulator to the initial state. Note that the system configuration parameters will not be initialized.

---------------------------------------
## <a id="device-object-instances">Device object instances</a>

The Device Object Instances area on the top screen shall manage devices to be emulated. By default, the node profile (EOJ:`0x0EF001`) and home air conditioner (EOJ:`0x013001`) are registered. 

Switching the device using the pull-down menu displays a list of corresponding device properties and their values underneath the device.
